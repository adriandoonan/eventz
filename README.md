# Eventz!

This is a project created as part of the Ironhack web development bootcamp. Its aim is to showcase creative and artistic events.

## Running locally

The project is built using react as a frontend and a mock API provided by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as the backend. For more information on the backend, see the related [event-backend github repository](https://github.com/adriandoonan/eventz-backend).

We build using vite so once you have cloned the project just `npm install` and `npm run dev` to get the site up an running on localhost.
